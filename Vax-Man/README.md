## Vax-Man

This project alternative Pac-Man with new rules from Forage Electronic Arts Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program.

* Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
* Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
* Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
* The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.
